                <h2>History & Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Petra, often referred to as the "Rose City" due to the color of the stone from which it is carved,
                    is an archaeological marvel located in southern Jordan. Established as early as 312 BC as the
                    capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom, Petra thrived as a major trading hub, connecting various
                    civilizations through its strategic location along caravan routes.

                <p>
                    The city is renowned for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. The most iconic
                    structure in Petra is Al-Khazneh (The Treasury), a magnificent façade carved into a sandstone cliff,
                    which served as a royal tomb. Other notable structures include the Monastery (Ad Deir), the Royal
                    Tombs, and the Great Temple. Petra's intricate network of tombs, temples, and dwellings showcases
                    the advanced engineering and artistic skills of the Nabataeans.

                <p>
                    Petra was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, bringing it back into
                    global awareness. In 1985, Petra was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its
                    outstanding universal value as a cultural and historical landmark. Today, Petra is one of the most
                    visited tourist attractions in the Middle East, drawing visitors from around the world to marvel at
                    its ancient splendor and rich history.
